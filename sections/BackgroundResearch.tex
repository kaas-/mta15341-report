\section{Previous scientific work}
Andersen et al. \citep{andersen_designing_2004} created a board game utilising physical and digital components. For their physical components they used flat squares with patterns that through Augmented Reality (AR) technologies will be recognised through a camera and/or Virtual Reality goggles. Their research was made to illustrate "design issues for AR board games".
