\section{Introduction}
(To the whole group, while standing by the table)
Hello, and thank you all for agreeing to participate in our test. We have created this touch board table on which you can play the board game Terra Mystica. The game plays the same as the original Terra Mystica, but instead of using tokens to terraform, you touch the board.

We will start out by playing a game of Terra Mystica (in its original version/with an interactive touch board). You will be playing this game for [amount of time we will play], and you are encouraged to, while you play, talk amongst each other about the game as well as the board\todo{skal vi både have dem til at snakke om brættet når de spiller begge udgaver af TM?}. After you have played the first version, we want you to play the other one, for a same amount of rounds. When you have played the two games, we will hold a short interview where you will be asked questions about your thoughts towards the augmented game. In this interview, you will also be asked to compare this version to the original game.

(When introducing to augmented version)
To start your turn, you place your hand on the player selection using your gesture. Player 1 will take their turn like this [show how to select player 1], player 2 like this [show player 2], player 3 like this [show player 3], and player 4 like this [show player 4]. On your turn, you can terraform a tile like this [show the participants how to terraform].

\section{Post-test interview}
The following are points which needs coverage. This means that they should be used for a semistructured interview, made up by the questions raised from the testing and from the following: \todo{er det vigtigt at få pointeret et sted at der tydelig skal spørges "hvorfor/hvorfor ikke" hvis et 'hvorfor' svar ikke gives til spørgsmålene?}
\begin{itemize}
\item How did you think the augmented Terra Mystica compared to the original game?
\begin{itemize}
\item Do you still feel like you were playing the same game when you were playing the augmented version?
\end{itemize}
\item Did you experience difficulty when indicating that it was your turn? Was it a hindrance? \todo{Mulig rettelse: How was it indicate that it was your turn in the augmented game? What made it easier? What made it more difficult?}
\begin{itemize}
\item How is the experience in comparison to when playing the original game?
\end{itemize}
\item Did you experience ease or difficulty when terraforming compared to the original game?
\item Do you think the augmented game can serve as a possible replacement for the original board?
\item How do you think the game's pace was affected by the augmentation? Do you think it was increased/decreased?
\end{itemize}
