\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
Board games come in many shapes, sizes, and levels of complexity. While some people see complexity as a pleasant challenge, others find it to be overwhelming. Therefore, these games can be intimidating to play. One reason for this is the fact that the players themselves are the only ones who can make sure that the game is being played according to the rules.

By incorporating computer-controlled elements into the board game, this project attempts to digitise and automate parts of it. This is to investigate whether a partial digitisation of the game can maintain the experience and enjoyment of playing the board game, while having certain parts handled by a computer.
