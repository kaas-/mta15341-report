\section{Purpose of test}
The purpose of this test is to test usability and functionality of the product. The ISO 9241 \citep{ISO} standard defines usability as effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the user. Put more precisely, this means:
\begin{itemize}
\item Efectiveness: To what extent are the goals of the product achieved?
\item Efficiency: What resources (including time) are expended to achieve the goals?
\item Satisfaction: To what extent does the user find the system acceptable?
\end{itemize}
With these in mind, the test aims to clarify whether the product lives up to its test objectives.

\section{Test objectives}
Our problem statement is defined in Section~\ref{sec:ProblemStatement}. Based on this problem statement, it is important not only to test how well the program functions on a technical level, but also if the test participants still feel like they are playing the original board game, which will be tested on a level of satisfaction/acceptance.
The success criteria (Section~\ref{sec:SuccessCriteria}) and the system requirements (Section~\ref{sec:ReqSpec}) each add to the specifications on the technical and satisfactory  objectives of the test.
These parts together make up these test objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do the players still feel like they are playing Terra Mystica, when they are playing the augmented version? \todo{this might need specifications or a broader question}
\item Do the players feel like taking turns using the player selection gestures is an easy task, or a hindrance?
\item How well are players able to undo mistakes they did while terraforming?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Furthermore, does the player selection task live up to the requirement specification that it should be successful 90\% of the time?
\end{enumerate}
\item Do the players feel like the task of terraforming is easier to carry out than on the original board game?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Furthermore, does the terraforming task live up to the requirement specification that it should be successful 75\% of the time?
\end{enumerate}
\item How easily are players able to undo mistakes they did while terraforming?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Furthermore, does the undo task live up to the requirement specification that it should be successful 50\% of the time?
\end{enumerate}
\item Do the players feel that the augmented game board can replace the original game board?
\item How hindered is the pace of the game by the three actions each player can take (chose player, terraform and undo)?
\end{enumerate}

These objectives set the goals for the test, and help determine whether or not the test is successful. 

\section{Test methods}
The test methods used, their criteria and their measurement are meant to see if the test objectives are met.

\subsection{Test set-up}
The test will take place in a controlled setting, were nobody else than the test participants and testers will be present around the board while a game is taking place. The participants will be playing, and the testers will only act as observers who document the proceedings, and helpers/guides - in case the participants have any technical problems that prevent them from proceeding from the test.
The documentation of the test will be done by a tester filming the participants playing the game and a note-taker that also acts as the spokesperson for the testers.
