\section{Formulation}

\subsection{Success Criteria}
\todo{this description seems vague, I might fix it later, else I am open for ideas}In order for our project to become a successful one, we have set these criteria:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The projection software must be able to make the image of the board game show one of seven different tiles in each interactive tile, and make tiles changeable, in order to make the user able to do terraforming in the game.
	\item The augmented board game board must be usable for a whole game, so that the augmented version of Terra Mystica could replace the unaugmented one. That also means a game of Terra Mystica should not be halted or stopped by any technical problems.
	\item The computer vision software needs to register some sort of BLOB, in order to make the board game change the tiles. This means an implementation image processing that works with the projection of the board.
\end{itemize} \todo{maybe more can be added, but I don't know what}
