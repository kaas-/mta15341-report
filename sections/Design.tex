\section{An interactive board for Terra Mystica}
This project aims to create an interactive board for Terra Mystica, that uses Computer Vision to detect hand contact on the board via a camera below its surface. With the hand contact, the user should be able to change the colour of the hexagon-shaped tiles in the game. The idea is that the board itself is a projection from below, and the board should change according to inputs on the interaction with the board's surface.

The interactive board will eliminate the need for terrain game pieces, since it will manage terraforming digitally for the player. It may also assist the players in remembering the Power mechanic, as well as streamline other elements of the game.

A possible expansion of the project would be detection of game pieces, which can be used to measure amount of 'power' after game piece placement.
