\section{Further Implementation}
Aside from the product's minimum implementation requirements, it is possible to make further iterations, suggested in this chapter. These are based on design ideas for the program from before its implementation. There are also further implementation ideas based on opinions and suggestions from the evaluation results and the experiences after the technical test.

\subsection{Improvement of terraforming}
Although the implementation of an undo button was originally planned, it did not become a part of the current version. Participants of the usability test(Section~\ref{ch:testeval}) have been mentioning a need for such a function, while also giving ideas to how such a function could be implemented(Section~\ref{satisfactionResult}). It could be via a button, which as a part of the board's GUI, while still apart of the game board's map, can reverts the last terraforming action taken in the game. An algorithm for this function could be a stacking system that remembers previous actions, allowing the program to revert them, returning to previous states of the program. Another solution could be an improvement of the terraforming action. Anyone, regardless of whose turn it is, should then be able to change a tile to any type of terrain in the game. This would help users undo mistakes, by letting them change the tiles back to what the player originally intended or back to their original state. A possible problem in the multiple choice solution could be its dependency on players' memory regarding what the terrain of the hexes originally were before the mistaken terraforming. 

\subsection{Improvement of taking turns}
\todo{Daniel demands an addition of some technical further implementation in this subsection}Participants of the usability test in Section~\ref{ch:testeval} had ideas how to improve the turn taking further, besides improve in its programming. They mentioned that instead of having the turn switching be by having a hand hovering/pressing against the middle of the surface, one should should be able to switch turns by interacting with an area specifically only for switching turns. This solution could  also make its programming somewhat easier, since it could base its gesture recognition on location, rather than it being based on shape\todo{"...which was a problem in the technical test" - or was it? Someone confirm+add this or remove this suggestion}.

%Another additional function to include could be for each player to choose their own faction from the game. Also, one should be able to add a colour to that faction, so it would display the chosen colour on the board when it was the faction’s turn. When a faction is selected, its counterpart (the backside of a faction’s card), should be inaccessible.

%Lastly, the global power actions mentioned in Section \ref{sec:BoardInterface} could be an interactive function instead of spaces that you put game pieces on. The idea is to make the players able to press the powers, which would then make the powers become inaccessible. An advanced version of this function could have the program register faction rules, which would make the global actions still accessible to them. 

%\subsection{Player assistance}
%In order to assist players and streamline the game pace, the following further implementations could be done.

%The program could remember which players have placed their buildings on each tile. When a player places or upgrades a building next to a tile which is occupied by another player, the game could remind one player to offer the other power. Ideally, even the specific type of building already occupying the surrounding tiles is remembered by the program, allowing it to calculate exactly how much power is to be offered to a player.

%As of now, the interface has the global goals for each round displayed, but they are fixed, as opposed to randomised like in the original game. A possible iteration for this is to make the program draw randomised one-round goals in the beginning of the game, keeping each game unique. Goals for previous rounds that are no longer relevant could be hidden.

%Another possible iteration is to make the colour of the currently selected player visible on the board, perhaps in the form of a border around the board. This way, players will not be in doubt whether or not they have correctly selected a player.

%To assist the player with the management of their points during and at the end of the game, a feature which does the point registration and mathematical tasks could be added. In order for this to work, some subtraction and addition in a player’s amount of points should happen due what happens in the game and what the state of the game is at its end. Examples of such scenarios are: when a player receives power that would make them lose points, when a player reaches specific goals in the game, when a player places a specific building, etc. 

%In the original game, each player has a card containing all information about their chosen race. This card could be made digital. This would open up the opportunity for players to ask the game for tips about specific icons and what they mean, in case they fail to remember.

%Furthermore, the card keeping track of how many points each player has with each cult could be made digital. This digital board could react when players pass the given milestones on the track, reminding them to receive power. If this and the aspect overseeing goals are both implemented, the cult track could even award the players with the correct one-round bonuses currently in effect.  

%\subsection{Technical tweaks}
%As the original game can be played by 2-5 players, an ideal iteration of the program is to widen its capacity to 5 players. For a more advanced implementation, the board's GUI could change, due to the numbers of players in the game.

%To achieve more precise BLOBs and make the program respond better to user input, a background subtraction step can be added to the segmentation process.
