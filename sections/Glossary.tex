\textbf{RDI}: \todo{Daniel needs to learn how to reference to specific pages if that is a necessity}Rear Diffused Illumination is the name of a solution of a multi-touch device\citep{multiTT}. This solution has an optical sensor, which in in infra-red captures the contrast between a silent image and objects touching the surface. \todo{if needed, more can be added}

\textbf{LED}: Light-emitting diode, which glows when voltage is applied to it, like for example a light bulb.

\textbf{IR}: Infra-red, which is radiant energy that is invisible to the human eye, due to it being of lower frequency and larger wavelength than visible light.

\textbf{BLOB}: Binary Large Object, which is an object made up from connected pixels in an binary image.
