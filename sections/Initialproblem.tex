\chapter{Initial Problem}\label{ch:iniprob}
In this section, the basic criteria for this semester project are explained. From this, the initial problem is defined.

The goal of this project is to develop an augmented board game that makes use of computer vision. Based on this, as well as the semester requirements, four basic criteria for the project are defined:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The product of this project must be a media artefact.
	\item The artefact must implement computer vision in such a way that makes it interactive.
	\item The artefact must include an existing board game that we have access to.
	\item The implemented computer vision must not make the act of playing more convoluted.
\end{enumerate}

The board game chosen for this project is Terra Mystica.

\section{A short introduction to Terra Mystica}
Terra Mystica is a strategy board game for 2-5 players about territory control and resource management. Each player can choose one of 14 races, each of which has their own playstyle and terrain. The board consists of hexagonal tiles  with different kinds of terrain. Players can only build structures on tiles with terrain that matches their race. This terrain can, however, be modified by players if they choose to spend the required resources through a process which is referred to as \textit{terraforming}. Finally, the game involves a Power mechanic; if a player places or upgrades a building adjacent to the structures of another player, that player can choose to gain Power at the cost of victory points. Power can be used as a resource to do certain actions.

Victory points are gained based on objectives, some of which are global (obtainable by each player), while others are race-specific. The winner is the player that has the most victory points at the end of the game.

\section{Initial Problem statement}
From this, an initial problem statement is defined: 

\textit{How can a media artefact augment Terra Mystica through an implementation of computer vision?}

To answer this question, research questions are defined:

\textit{How can Computer Vision be used to facilitate user interaction?}

\textit{How can the software for a virtual board be developed?}
