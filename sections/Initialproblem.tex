\chapter{Initial Problem}\label{ch:iniprob}
In this section, the basic criteria for this semester project will be explained. From this, the initial problem will be defined.

The goal of this project is to develop an 'augmented' board game that makes use of computer vision. Based on this, as well as the semester requirements, five basic criteria for the project are defined:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The product of this project must be a media artefact.
	\item The artefact must implement computer vision in such a way that makes it interactive.
	\item The artefact must include an existing board game that we have access to.
	\todo {maybe game time is a irrelevant as requirement} \item The chosen board game must not have an average game time of over two hours.
	\item The implemented computer vision must not make the act of playing more convoluted.
\end{enumerate}

The board game chosen for this project is Terra Mystica.

\section{A short introduction to Terra Mystica} \todo {this sections belongs in design}
Terra Mystica is a strategy board game for 2-5 players about territory control and resource management. Each player can choose one of 14 races, each of which has their own playstyle. The board consists of hexagons with different kinds of terrain. Players can only build structures on hexes with terrain which matches their race. This terrain can, however, be modified by players if they choose to spend the required resources. This process of changing the terrain of a tile is referred to as 'terraforming'. Finally, the game involves a Power mechanic; if a player modifies a piece of terrain next to the structures of another player, that player can choose to gain Power at the cost of Victory Points, which can be spent on acquiring resources.  

Victory Points are gained based on objectives, some of which are global (obtainable by each player), while the others are race-specific. The winner is the player that has the most Victory Points at the end of the game.

The game involves many loose pieces for the players to manage (namely when terraforming), and the Power mechanic is often forgotten by the players.

\section{An interactive board for Terra Mystica}
This project aims to create an interactive board for Terra Mystica, that uses Computer Vision to detect hand contact on the board via a camera below its surface. With the hand contact, the user should be able to change the colour of the hexagon-shaped tiles in the game. The idea is that the board itself is a projection from below, and the board should change according to inputs on the interaction with the board's surface.

The interactive board will eliminate the need for terrain game pieces, since it will manage terraforming digitally for the player. It may also assist the players in remembering the Power mechanic, as well as streamline other elements of the game.

\todo {I am uncertain if the following text has any relevance here or it should be added in the report later. }
\todo {Emilie: The stuff below will probably be moved to the design chapter, disregard it for now.}
A possible expansion of the project, would be detection of game pieces, which can be used to measure amount of 'power' after game piece placement. \todo{Daniel: This part of the text might be legit here in its reduced version}

\section{Initial Problem statement}
From this, an initial problem statement is defined: 

\textit{How can a media artefact that 'augments' Terra Mystica through an implementation of Computer Vision be developed?}

To answer this question, research questions are defined:

\textit{How can Computer Vision be used to facilitate user interaction?}

\textit{How can the software for a virtual board be developed?}

\subsection{Target Group Explained}
\todo{This target description maybe needs to be more specific. The aim with this description, so that our focus later on usability does not have to be aimed at users, who normally rarely plays boardgames} Our target group is people who are experienced with board games, maybe even Terra Mystica. They are aged 14 and above, as that is the recommended age group for players of the game Terra Mystica.
