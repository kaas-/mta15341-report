Our development chapter. 

\section{Physical Design} 
This section will describe the physical aspect of our product.
We have assembled a touch board, made with a plexi glass top and IR lamps below. Underneath the top is a short throw projector so we are able to project images on the top. Additionally we have a web camera on the very bottom of the table to be able to detect, via the IR lamps any changes, in form of touches or placed game pieces, in the surface of the board. 
The area of the top of the table useful to us is 74cm*58cm since this is the area the web camera can see. The entire table is 102cm*120cm.
