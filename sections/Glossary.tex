\textbf{Augmentation}: In this project, augmentation is defined as an enhancement of a non-digital artefact by digital means.

\textbf{BLOB}: Binary Large Object, which is an object made up from connected pixels in a binary image.

\textbf{IR}: Infra-red, which is radiant energy that is invisible to the human eye, due to it being of lower frequency and larger wavelength than visible light.

\textbf{LCD}: Liquid Crystal Display is the technology used for displays in notebooks and other smaller computers. LCDs allow displays to be much thinner than Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) technology.

\textbf{LED}: Light-emitting diode, which glows when voltage is applied to it, like for example an LED light bulb.

\textbf{Power}: A currency in the game Terra Mystica which is used to do certain actions.

\textbf{RDI}: Rear Diffused Illumination is a multi-touch device solution \citep{multiTT}. This solution has an optical sensor, which in infra-red captures the contrast between a silent image and objects touching the surface.

\textbf{Terraforming}: A game mechanic in Terra Mystica, where the player changes a tile in the game into a tile  on which they can place game pieces. This is necessary, since each player can only place game pieces on one kind of terrain.
