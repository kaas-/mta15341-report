\chapter{Initial Problem}\label{ch:ch2label}
Here we will explain our initial ideas and criteria we based our choices on.

We have based our initial problem formulation on our semester theme and our chosen project recommendation. Because of this, we wanted our initial problem formulation to be based on computer vision and a augmented board game, with the augmentation being based on computer vision. As we tried to specify what our analysis of the initial problem formulation should cover, we generated several ideas through brainstorming.

Those ideas each had a chosen board game, chosen technology needed for the ideas and a rough project process planning. Furthermore, all the ideas went through some criteria, in order to filter our ideas.
The criteria were:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The idea must implement computer vision, since that is what we will need to fulfil our curriculum.
	\item The idea must include a existing board game that we have access to. So we do not design our own board game from scratch.
	\item The implemented computer vision for the idea must be interactive. This was important for us to remember, in order to stick with the main course of 3rd semester in the curriculum.
	\item The playtime of the idea's chosen board game must not have an average game time over two hours. This criteria was based on the assumption that if the game's playtime was too long, it would be harder to test it properly.
	\item 
\end{enumerate}
