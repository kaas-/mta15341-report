Primary Interviewer: ”Now you indicate that it’s your turn”

Female 1: ”Oh that’s done like this. Then I want to terraform and build a house here *points*”

Primary Interviewer: ”You need to use three fingers”

Female 1: ”Oh okay, and I get to build a house too right?”

Primary Interviewer: ”Yes, I’m only here to be the system, doesn’t it cost coins from you too?”

Female 1: ”Yeah it does, but one more for terraforming”

Primary Interviewer: ”It was three for terraforming and one to build”

Female 2: ”So one shovel is three workers?”

Primary Interviewer: ”One shovel is three workers”

Primary Interviewer: ”Then it’s your turn”

Female 2: ”Then I have to do this”

Primary Interviewer: ”Please spread your fingers, like this”

Female 2: ”Okay”

Female 2: ”Then I want to terraform this one”

Primary Interviewer: ”Okay”

Primary Interviewer: ”So I need what? four workers”

Female 2: ”Yes, and then I need to place a house”

Male: ”What should I terraform, since I also be joining, I think I’ll just”

Primary Interviewer: ”You have to indicate that it’s your turn”

Male: ”Indicating it’s my turn”

Primary Interviewer: ”Yes”

Male: ”And then I pick this one, and I have to use six workers on it, and then I can’t do anything else, nice”

Primary Interviewer \& Female 1: ”So you terraformed?”

Male: ”Yeah”

Primary Interviewer: ”yes”

Male: ”I’m giants, oh wait I’m gonna use this free shovel, then I get three workers to work with, then I’m gonna use some coins, and build a house.”

Primary Interviewer: ”Then it’s your turn”

Female 1: ”I’m gonna pass”

Primary Interviewer: ”Can’t do anything else?”

Female 1: ”Only got two workers”

Male: ”But can you terraform anything?”

Female 1: ”No because I only got two”

Female 2: ”When is it you use these?”

Primary Interviewer: ”I think you can upgrade one of you houses”

Male: ”Then you’ll need 9 coins”

Female 1: ”Don’t worry I got that, but it’s just if I want points from the house”

Primary Interviewer: ”you could also use those, which are place here, without any icons on”

Secondary Interviewer: ”So you can get two shovels”

Male: ”Yeah for six power”

Female 1: ”Especially now that we, no wait”

Male: ”But you need it over here before you can use it”

Secondary Interviewer: ”You can just burn it from number 2”

Male: ”Ohh yeah you can burn it from number 2, Burn everything”

Female 1: ”But I’m not going to do anything.“

Primary Interviewer: ”You’re not gonna do anything, then you are out of the round”

Female 2: ”Is it three or six coins for upgrading?”

Primary Interviewer: ”It’s six coins if you aren’t next to an opponent, and 3 if you are. So if you upgrade this one, it’s only three coins.”

Female 2: ”Okay then I pick that. Do I need to do anything special to indicate I’m doing that?”

Primary Interviewer: ”No you just have to pay here”

Female 2: ”And it was only three coins”

Male: ”Then you have to ask if she wants power”

Female 1: ”So I move from here to here? Do I move one or two?”

Male: ”Move like this”

Secondary Interviewer: ”One”

Primary Interviewer: ”Okay”

Female 1: ”Yes more I can burn”

Primary Interviewer: ”Then it’s you”

Male: ”You know what I don’t need to terraform this, So I need to indicate it’s me or what?”

Primary Interviewer: ”No you don’t have to but you can do it, it’s not necessary”

Male: ”Okay, well I do that, to make sure it works, I don’t need to terraform this so I pay, and get 3 coins back, and place a house”

Primary Interviewer: ”Then it’s your turn”

Female 2: ”I’m going to pass”

Male: ”Should I keep going?”

Primary Interviewer: ”Anything else you want or can do?”

Male: ”I got seven up here, so I’m going to burn six”

Primary Interviewer: ” and getting two shovels?

Male: ”Yes and getting two shovels”

Primary Interviewer: ”That’s smart”

Female 1: ”Well you are alone”

Male: ” yeah, I’m playing for myself”

Primary Interviewer: ”So you are building a house more”

Male: ”yeah and then I pass”

Primary Interviewer: ”So first round is now over, you get victory points, which are irrelevant for the test, and the turn order is still 1, 2, 3”

Primary Interviewer: ”So you start again”

Female 1: ”So I’m going to terraform”

Primary Interviewer: ”You have to indicate it is your turn”

Female 1: ”Oh yeah, it’s me, and then i’m going to terraform, this one. And i get a house on it”

Female 1: ”It’s very hard to remember that I have to activate every turn”

Female 2: ”I’m going to terraform this one, then it’s four workers and two coins”

Primary Interviewer: ”You just place a house”

Male: ”I think I’m going to... First it’s me. Then do like this, which costs me six workers”

Primary Interviewer: ”Then it’s your turn”

Female 1: ”I’m going to upgrade”

Female 1: ”Isn’t it only three power?”

Primary Interviewer: ”Yes”

Male:“Isn’t it only special places where you can build bridges?” 

Secondary Interviewer: ”Yes technically it is”

Primary Interviewer: ”You can”

Female 1: ”So I can build a bridge?”

Primary Interviewer: ”Yes”

Female 1: ”I build a bridge”

Primary Interviewer: ”They are in the box”

Female 1: ”But I can’t build it yet”

Male: ”You have to place it immediately”

Female 1: ”Oh okay”

Primary Interviewer: ”It has to be place on one of the lines”

Female 1: ”Then I won’t be able to make my town”

Female 2: ”I’m going to pass”

Primary Interviewer: ”Then it’s your turn”

Female 1: ”I burn six power to get two workers”

Male: ”Two workers have been used”

Female 1: ”But I can use my own way”

Primary Interviewer: ”Okay”

Female 1: ”What can I build? I’m gonna pass”’

Primary Interviewer: ”Now you are all done with round two. Now for the fun part.”

\textbf{Questions}

Primary Interviewer: ”This is going to be a nice interactive board, but the general idea of getting a bigger board is it nice? That is have been set up this way?

Male: ”I think it is easier with touch control and such, if it was the normal board it would have been a bit harder for me to place my fingers on it, so I think it’s okay. 

Primary Interviewer: ” It wasn’t a problem placing 3 fingers on it?

Male: ”No it’s okay, The only problem though is if I want to “go over there” Now i got long arms so it isn’t that big of a deal”

Female 1: ”I can’t reach”

Male: ” that’s like the only thing”

Female 1: ”It’s just that small people can’t stand at the ends of the table”

Female 2: ”they have to stand where i stand”

Primary Interviewer: ”that’s very accurate”

Female 2: ”I agree with what they said”

Female 1: ”But there aren’t any problem with have the fingers inside the hexes”

Primary Interviewer: ”The thing with remembering to activate”

Female 1: ” I think it comes by itself when you play the game some more.”

Female 2: ” I think it would help with some light or something like that”

Primary Interviewer: ” that is the plan with the finished product”

Male: ”I would like it when a new round starts, register as new player, I could imagine if I was playing with friends, then at some point we forget whose turn it is, and then we have to backtrack”

Female 1: ”Some way of finding out which player you are, are you player one or am i player one?”

Male: ”normally you have an extra board for that, but I think it would be a good idea to visualise it somehow”

Female 1: ”I think it’s weird that you have to use 3 fingers when you terraform, but when you build, you just place the house. It makes sense after the second round, then it’s easy to understand. But it was rather hard to remember in the start.

Primary Interviewer: ”It would make more sense to make a gesture when you place a house?”

Female 1: ”Yeah 

Male: ”I feel that half of it has been integrated into the interactive board, and the other half hasn’t, It’s confusing”

Primary Interviewer: ” So it’s confusing that we haven’t made it all touch?”

Male: ”I feel confused by that I have to make a gesture on the board, then find a game piece which is next to the board and place it. But it isn’t that big of a problem, I think it is just a question about playing it a few times.”

Female 2: ”I agree, but I also find it weird/confusing that when I upgrade, I don’t have to do anything.”

Primary Interviewer: ”Would it make more sense if the house was a picture on the board, that you could interact with?”

Female 1: ”I think so”

Male: ”I personally feel that it would remove the interactive part of the board game, a thing about this game is the vast amount of pieces and I really like it. If you digitalize all the pieces, it could give a feeling of, is this actually terra mystica.

Primary Interviewer: ”You would lose some of the board game feel?”

Male: ”Yes”

Female 1: ”Maybe prepare the tiles for what is about to happen, because then you would still have some interactivity with the board, because it is weird that I only have to use 3 finger when I terraform, but just place a house when I build it. Maybe just like a heads up to say, hey I’m building a house”
