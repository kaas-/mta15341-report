\section{Purpose of test}
The purpose of this test is to test usability and functionality of the product. The ISO 9241 \citep{ISO} standard defines usability as efectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the user. Put more precisely, this means:
\begin{itemize}
\item Efectiveness: To what extent are the goals of the product achieved?
\item Efficiency: What resources (including time) are expended to achieve the goals?
\item Satisfaction: To what extent does the user find the system acceptable?
\end{itemize}
With these in mind, the test aims to clarify whether the product lives up to its test objectives.

\section{Test objectives}
Our problem statement is defined in Section~\ref{sec:ProblemStatement}. Based on this problem statement, it is important not only to test how well the program functions on a technical level, but also if the test participants still feels like they are playing the original board game, which will be tested on a level of satisfaction/acceptance.
