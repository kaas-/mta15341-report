}{% the abstract
  This project deals with an augmentation of the board game Terra Mystica through computer vision. This was done by making a touch board, using rear diffused illumination and BLOB detection methods. It was concluded through usability testing that the final prototype was not sufficient to fulfil the problem statement.
