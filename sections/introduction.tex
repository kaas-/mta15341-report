\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

Board games come in many shapes, sizes, and levels of complexity. While some people see complexity as a pleasant challenge, others find it to be overwhelming, and therefore are these games intimidating to play. This is due to the players themselves are the only ones that can make sure that the game is being played according to the rules.

By incorporating computer-controlled elements into the board game, this project attempts to digitise and automate parts of it. This is to investigate, if a partly digitisation of the game can maintain the experience and enjoyment of play, while having certain parts handled by a computer.
